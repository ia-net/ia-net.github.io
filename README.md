# ia-net blog (minimal c# console blog)

This repository is a minimal blog system built with a C# console application and a few NuGet packages.  
It was created as a personal experiment to explore how simple a blog can be without using heavy frameworks or CMS platforms.  
The blog displays plain text or Markdown posts directly in the console and reflects my interests in .NET, Azure Cloud, and MSSQL.  
The goal is to show that sharing ideas does not require complexity, sometimes a simple console and a few tools are enough.
